// BloomFilter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.
// It is space-efficient and allows for false positives, meaning it can indicate that an element is in the set when it is not.
// The BloomFilter uses a bit array and multiple hash functions to determine membership.
// It is particularly useful in scenarios where the set is large and memory efficiency is crucial, such as in databases or network applications.
// A BloomFilter can be used to quickly check if an element is possibly in the set, without storing the actual elements.
// The BloomFilter struct contains a bit array and a hash function to manage the membership of elements.
// The bit array is represented as a slice of booleans, where each index corresponds to a bit.
// The hash function is used to compute the indices in the bit array that should be set for each element added to the BloomFilter.
